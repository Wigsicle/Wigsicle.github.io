00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,440
Hello, I'm Chris on behalf of Team 7A.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,280
Last week's pitch got us thinking:

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,920
Data alone doesn't move people. Today,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,360
I'll show how the team progressed through

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,040
each phase of the double diamond design

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,960
process, what we learned from talking to

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,800
stakeholders and what our prototypes

8
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,760
taught us. In the discover phase,

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,080
we avoided yes/no or leading questions

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,080
and framed our enquiry with "how might

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,480
we" questions to surface real needs with

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,160
questions like "how might we engage the

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,160
user to interact with the QR code from

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,480
our poster?" From Sally, we heard that

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,080
current solutions were just graphs and

16
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,960
numbers and lacked human context.

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,160
Instead, she stressed, people really

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,080
respond to film/stories being told.

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,560
What we learned was that even with our

20
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,800
prototypes, which Sally really liked, we

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,640
still need to figure out a way to get

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,800
past the mental barriers of users of the

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,320
River Kelvin to interact with our

24
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,040
solutions. Next, in the Define

25
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,880
phase, we surface our mental models

26
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,000
explicitly by gathering what we learned

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,880
from the stakeholder meeting. We each

28
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,600
answered what matters most. raw accuracy

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,000
or emotional resonance. This exercise,

30
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,400
grounded in our shared mental models

31
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,000
exercises, help us avoid blind spots and

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,080
align on the true problem, making the

33
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,080
river condition both understandable and

34
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,440
compelling. Once we surfaced our

35
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,400
assumptions, we notice two conflicting

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,080
mental models. Model A, on-site and

37
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,200
on-sight, where people expect physical

38
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,040
glanceable warnings, and Model B,

39
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,440
remotely, where users want rich digital

40
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,840
content and community submissions. To

41
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,960
reconcile these, we turned to integrative

42
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,040
thinking. Rather than choosing one or the

43
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,960
other, we fused them. In our D

44
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,520
develop phase, we built a low-fidelity mix

45
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,000
of paper posters, prototype gauges, and a

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,080
QR-linked site where users could upload

47
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,200
sightings as stories or contribute to

48
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,200
warnings. We have since improved the

49
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,240
designs in our med to hi-fi prototyping

50
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,560
progression. Here is our physical story

51
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,280
poster and our story

52
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,616
digital counterpart.

53
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,800
And finally, our water information poster

54
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,200
and HiFi digital prototype with an AI

55
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,120
model to predict water levels. With

56
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,320
that, we set out to the River Kelvin for

57
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,160
field testing and usability scale.

58
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,440
We expected questions on chart clarity

59
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,840
and the data, but two elderly visitors

60
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,160
immediately scanned to read user stories

61
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,880
and noted they'd only scanned if they

62
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,320
told a narrative. Others said, "Put it

63
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,400
all on the poster!" to avoid scanning.

64
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,840
This tension between minimal friction and

65
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,800
rich storytelling reshaped our thinking.

66
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,160
So what we learned from building our

67
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,120
prototypes was that our reframed approach

68
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,280
uses eye-catching posters and gauges at

69
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,760
the rivers edge as the front door, with a

70
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,000
QR-linked story builder at the backend,

71
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,200
delivering both immediate visibility and

72
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,480
deeper digital engagement. From

73
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,600
presenting our prototypes to stakeholders

74
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,640
and actual river users, we learned 2

75
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,360
lessons. First, low-cost, "fail-fast"

76
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,840
mocks, surfaced what genuinely matters

77
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,360
far quicker than polished design.

78
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,520
Secondly, the experience - prototypes

79
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,880
that let people live the story. Imagining

80
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,880
a loved one at risk uncover emotional

81
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,960
drivers you can't see on static slides.

82
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,240
For example, even though there are

83
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,880
physical algae bloom warnings at the

84
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,200
river, a Glasgow dog owner had her dog

85
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,240
needing hospital attention after swimming

86
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,360
in the river. This personal experience

87
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,240
would prompt her empathy to participate

88
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,800
and scan the QR code to warn other users.

89
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,680
This insight will guide our next

90
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,400
iteration. In the Deliver

91
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,920
phase, our next-gen prototype is a mobile

92
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,480
story builder. Users scan a QR,

93
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,560
choose "add warning" or "share story",

94
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,560
then follow guided prompts to upload a

95
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,120
photo or text. Behind the scenes,

96
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,800
Friends of the River Kelvin curate

97
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,360
submissions with UK protocols to manage

98
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,280
liability. Finally, our AI model

99
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,440
fuses flow data with crowd stories to

100
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,880
provide short-term river risk

101
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,240
predictions, melding the data with human

102
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,040
context. We learned about the Glasgow

103
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,320
Penguins, an anonymous artist who placed

104
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,080
clay Penguins at the River Kelvin to

105
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,600
liven it up. It has since garnered a

106
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
large community following, prompting

107
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,120
users to seek them out at the River

108
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,680
Kelvin. This further reinforces what we

109
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,280
learned before, that users need that

110
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,240
story element. In the future, we'll pilot

111
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,320
at 5 sites, collaborate with Glasgow

112
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,760
Penguins for local flair and A/B test

113
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,360
poster only versus QR first. Our

114
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,320
metrics: Story contribution per visitor,

115
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,560
repeat engagement and ultimately fewer

116
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,040
safety incidents. Thank you for

117
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,960
listening and we can't wait to present to

118
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,800
you our final prototype solution during

119
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,400
the exhibition at GUU.
