                        How can we accurately predict river flow rate and conditions to enhance the safety of the public
                        and protect wildlife, while also forecasting pollution levels downstream? Current data provided
                        by SEPA is often difficult for the general public to interpret, especially for anticipating
                        future conditions. There is also an increasing need to understand how the upstream flow rates
                        impact downstream pollution. Our challenge lies in making this information more accessible,
                        actionable, and predictive with possible integrations with weather data, AI modelling, and
                        community-contributed observations.

                    Our solution is justified by the urgent need for readily available,
                    reliable, and predictive information on river condition,
                    especially under climate change and risks of pollution.
                    SEPA information currently available, though comprehensive,
                    is not user-friendly to the public at large and lacks predictive quality.
                    Our application of AI modelling in the treatment of weather information
                    enhances the predictability of river behaviour patterns in the future,
                    which is critical to both public safety and environmental planning.

                    By integrating community-contributed observations,
                    we also integrate a citizen science component that improves
                    not just data coverage, but also public engagement and awareness.
                    The simple and intuitive visualisations employed ensure that complex data
                    is translated into actionable insights, rendering the platform useful to a

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Our design journey began with an in-depth discussion with our key stakeholder,
                        <em>Friends of the River Kelvin (FoRK)</em>. These meetings were crucial in helping us
                        understand both the environmental challenges facing the river and the communication gaps
                        between available data and the public. FoRK highlighted several pressing issues: a general
                        lack of awareness and education around river health, the serious problem of sewage and
                        chemical pollution in the UK, and the difficulty the public has in understanding the health
                        impacts of poor water quality. Although groups such as the Kelvin Biodiversity Network had
                        previously held exhibitions, their displays were mainly graphs and numbers — informative
                        but lacking background stories or emotional connection.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Our discussions also revealed gaps in existing monitoring and public information. Unlike
                        coasts and beaches, rivers in Glasgow do not display tide levels or safety conditions, and
                        riverfly surveys only cover certain months, missing incidents outside of this period. Data
                        from storms, chemical pollution, and other environmental factors is often not integrated or
                        updated frequently enough. There was also a strong desire to encourage people to see the
                        river as a place for leisure—canoeing, fishing, picnics—rather than simply a hazardous or
                        “off-limits” space.
                    </p>

                        <p class="font-semibold mb-2">From these conversations, we identified several opportunities:</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Inspired by FoRK’s feedback, we began prototyping solutions that could blend advocacy,
                        education,
                        and community participation. Our low-fidelity prototypes focused on layout concepts for physical
                        posters, mobile-friendly dashboards, and community story pages. We incorporated FoRK’s
                        suggestion
                        of creating relatable mascots (e.g., penguins with umbrellas or sunglasses to reflect
                        conditions)
                        to make information fun and approachable. Mid-fidelity prototypes tested QR usability, simple
                        data
                        visualisations, and moderation workflows for user-submitted content.

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Each iteration was shaped by further feedback—particularly around how to motivate ongoing
                        contributions
                        and how to ensure the platform remained trustworthy through curated, moderated content. By the
                        high-fidelity
                        stage, our designs combined AI-powered condition predictions, community-contributed
                        observations, and
                        story-based content, all accessible through both physical and digital touchpoints.

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Looking back, starting with stakeholder conversations grounded our entire design process. These
                        early meetings
                        didn’t just highlight the data gaps — they helped us understand the human motivations, fears,
                        and habits that
                        ultimately shaped our final solution. This approach ensured our design was not only technically
                        sound, but also
                        socially relevant and community-driven.

                What We're Proud Of
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mx-auto max-w-3xl text-left space-y-6">
                <span class="block mb-4">
                    This project was a meaningful opportunity for our team to bridge the gap between complex
                    environmental data and public understanding.
                    At its core, our aim was to take raw, often inaccessible datasets — such as those from SEPA — and
                    transform them into something that could directly inform and empower the community.
                    The challenge was not only technical but also human: how do we make people care about river
                    conditions and pollution trends in a way that inspires action?
                </span>

                <span class="block mb-4">
                    One of the strongest aspects of our journey was our <strong>iterative design process</strong>.
                    We began with rough, low-fidelity prototypes to quickly explore ideas without being tied to a single
                    vision.
                    Each version was refined based on feedback from real users and stakeholders, enabling us to evolve
                    from concept sketches into high-fidelity, functional designs.
                    This cycle of testing and refinement helped ensure that our solution remained both informative and
                    engaging, while also responsive to user needs.
                </span>

                <span class="block mb-4">
                    Collaboration played a central role.
                    Working closely with stakeholders such as <em>Friends of the River Kelvin</em> gave us real-world
                    insights into local concerns, technical constraints, and existing initiatives.
                    Visiting the river ourselves added an observational layer — seeing the environment firsthand helped
                    us better understand the challenges that data alone could not convey.
                    This combination of stakeholder dialogue and on-site research grounded our ideas in reality.
                </span>

                <span class="block mb-4">
                    However, the journey was not without obstacles.
                    We encountered <strong>limited data availability</strong>, which sometimes restricted our predictive
                    modelling capabilities.
                    Additionally, the technical complexity of the datasets meant that translating them into accurate,
                    user-friendly forecasts required careful interpretation.
                    A major ongoing challenge was finding the balance between educational content and visual appeal —
                    too much information could overwhelm the user, but too little could undercut the platform’s purpose.
                </span>

                <span class="block mb-4">
                    From these challenges came our most important lesson: <strong>storytelling is vital for public
                        engagement</strong>.
                    We realised that raw data, no matter how accurate, is not enough to motivate people.
                    It needs to be presented in a way that is relatable, visually clear, and emotionally resonant.
                    By incorporating narrative elements, real-world examples, and intuitive visualisations, we created a
                    platform that not only informs but also inspires curiosity and care for local rivers.
                </span>

                <span class="block mb-4">
                    We are proud of how far we progressed in a relatively short time.
                    Our solution demonstrates how the fusion of <strong>technology, design, and human-centered
                        thinking</strong> can make a real difference in environmental communication.
                    More than just a technical achievement, it’s a step toward fostering stronger connections between
                    people and their natural surroundings — encouraging the public to not just consume information, but
                    to act on it for the benefit of both the community and the environment.

                    <p class="text-gray-600">Going down to the river to interview members of the public, as well as to
                        observe the river conditions firsthand, was a valuable step in generating ideas to address the
                        problem. Speaking directly with people who regularly use or pass by the river provided insight
                        into their concerns, experiences, and suggestions, which might not have been captured through
                        desk research alone. At the same time, physically observing the river allowed me to notice
                        details such as water clarity, flow rate, litter, and how the surrounding environment interacts
                        with the river.

                        Through this project, I learned the importance of combining primary research with direct
                        observation. I realised that solutions are more effective when they are informed by both
                        community perspectives and on-the-ground realities. It also taught me that being present in the
                        environment you are trying to improve helps you develop a deeper understanding of the problem,
                        spot issues that might otherwise be overlooked, and think more creatively about practical
                        solutions</p>

                        When I joined this OIP project, I discovered communication was highly important for us. We
                        needed to stay in contact from beginning to end, know what was going on, and figure out problems
                        fast. I learned asking the right questions assists us in comprehending our issues more clearly
                        and knowing more about deeper beliefs. I also discovered that creating multiple prototypes and
                        testing out various ideas with feedback assisted us. This became a common activity for
                        implementing integrative thinking, which is keeping various prototype ideas in balance and
                        incorporating the better parts together for better solutions. We also developed a collaborative
                        sense of our goals, roles, and work processes at the same time. This assisted us in knowing what
                        the other needed at various times and operating effectively together. Throughout this journey, I
                        have learned a lot of soft skills that could enhance my software engineering role in the future
                        which I felt deeply appreciated.

                        Through this project, I learned the importance of starting
                        with a strong introduction and the appropriate questions to uncover
                        true user needs. Building up a common mental model within our
                        team brought us all together and helped align our vision and
                        decision-making. Prototyping early and often allowed us to rapidly
                        test concepts, and an opposable mind allowed us to entertain and
                        combine opposing perspectives. Usability testing was instrumental
                        in validating our hypotheses and iteratively refining the user experience.
                        Together, these practices deepened our understanding of human-centered
                        design and cemented our final solution.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    As a team, we are grateful for the invaluable opportunity to meet with Sally from Friends of the
                    River Kelvin (FoRK) and engage in meaningful discussions about the environmental challenges faced by
                    the River Kelvin. This meeting was not only a key milestone in our project but also a learning
                    experience that broadened our understanding of the wider environmental, social, and community
                    contexts in which our work is situated.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    One of the key themes we took away from our conversation with Sally is the complexity of river
                    conservation efforts. It became clear that environmental issues such as pollution, biodiversity
                    loss, and fluctuating water quality are deeply interconnected with community engagement, local
                    behaviour, and public awareness. Through Sally’s insights, we recognised that technical solutions
                    alone are not enough; the success of any intervention depends on fostering a sense of ownership and
                    responsibility within the local community. This has influenced the way we now frame our project
                    goals — shifting from a purely data-driven approach to one that integrates accessible communication
                    and community outreach.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    From multiple perspectives, we also learned that river health cannot be seen in isolation. Wider
                    factors such as urban development, climate patterns, local regulations, and even volunteer capacity
                    all play a role in shaping the state of the river. Sally’s perspective, grounded in years of
                    hands-on experience with FoRK, helped us appreciate the value of grassroots action and the realities
                    of implementing solutions on the ground. As a result, our project is now more attuned to the needs
                    and priorities of those actively working to protect the river.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    This reflection has led to genuine learning for our team. We have translated these lessons into
                    actionable insights by revisiting our project design to ensure our outputs are not only
                    scientifically sound but also publicly accessible and easy to interpret. For example, we are
                    incorporating more user-friendly data visualisations and considering ways to present predictive
                    information in formats that local residents can readily understand and act upon.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    We would like to sincerely thank Sally for her generosity with her time, her openness in sharing the
                    challenges FoRK faces, and her willingness to collaborate with us. Her contributions have helped
                    shape our project into something more impactful, relevant, and grounded in the lived reality of
                    those who care deeply for the River Kelvin. We look forward to continuing this collaboration and
                    contributing meaningfully to the shared goal of safeguarding the river’s future.
